# Afterthoughts

Due to constraints of time as the entire coding was done in 48 hours there are a few loose ends. The overall project was quite interesting as I got to play with sms api.
Looking forward to more such interesting challenges.

The nexmo api is a bit unstable but in production when we pay for their service I am assuming it will work fine.
